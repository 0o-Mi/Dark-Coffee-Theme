# Dark Coffee

#### with cinnamon, cats, tea, oranges and a bit of sunshine

<!-- Plugin description -->
#### Description:
- a modification of the dracula theme to make it reddish-orange dark instead of green.
- some java code coloring is present
- It's usable, most of the ui components have correct colors - let me know if something is missing

- inspired by warm-night theme form: https://github.com/mswift42/intellij-ui-themes

<!-- Plugin description end -->

#### known issues: 
- inactive window "bar" color is white
- code highlighting is still green - especially annoying in sql

Due to the pain of making themes in xml (no docs and a ton of variables referring to the same thing) fixing has been put on hold.
